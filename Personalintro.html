    <p>Favirote Culture that I am not native to is Italy. Italy is home to many great artists, such as Carvaggio and Michelangelo. I have always enjoyed Carvaggio's style, and Michelangelo's ability to create life in his sculptures</p>
    <p>I relate to Ulysses S Grant as he was a strong leader, and Pope John Paul II as he was an inspiration to many.</p>
    <p>A meal that represents me is cheese burgers.</p>
    <p>I feel most creative when I'm listening to music.</p>
